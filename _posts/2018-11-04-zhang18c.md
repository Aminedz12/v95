title: Person Re-identification by Mid-level Attribute and Part-based Identity Learning
abstract: Existing deep models using attributes usually take global features for identity
  classification and attribute recognition. However, some attributes exist in local
  position, such as a hat and shoes, therefore  global feature alone is insufficient
  for person representation. In this work, we propose to use the attribute recognition
  as an auxiliary task for person re-identification. The attributes are recognised
  from the local regions of mid-level layers. Besides, we extract local features and
  global features from a high-level layer for identity classification. The mid-level
  attribute learning improves the discrimination of high-level features, and the local
  feature is complementary to the global feature. We report competitive results on
  two large-scale person re-identification benchmarks, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID
  datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
