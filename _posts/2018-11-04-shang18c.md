title: Knowledge Guided Multi-instance Multi-label Learning via Neural Networks in
  Medicines Prediction
abstract: Predicting medicines for patients with co-morbidity has long been recognized
  as a hard task due to complex dependencies between diseases and medicines. Efforts
  have been made recently to build high-order dependency between diseases and medicines
  by extracting knowledge from electronic health records (EHR). But current works
  failed to utilize additional knowledge and ignored the data skewness problem which
  lead to sub-optimal combination of medicines. In this paper, we formulate the medicines
  prediction task in multi-instance multi-label learning framework considering the
  multi-diagnoses as input instances and multi-medicines as output labels. We propose
  a knowledge-guided multi-instance multi-label networks called \mname where two types
  of additional knowledge are incorporated into a RNN encoder-decoder model. The utilization
  of structural knowledge like clinical ontology provides a way to learn better representation
  called tree embedding by utilizing the ancestorsâ€™ information. Contextual knowledge
  is a global summarization of input instances which is informative for personal prediction.
  Experiments are conducted on a real world clinical dataset which showed the necessity
  to combine both contextual and structural knowledge and the \mname performs better
  than baselines up to 4+% in terms of Jaccard similarity score.
