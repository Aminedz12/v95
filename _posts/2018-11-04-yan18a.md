title: Deep Multi-instance Learning with Dynamic Pooling
abstract: End-to-end optimization of multi-instance learning (MIL) using neural networks
  is an important problem with many applications, in which a core issue is how to
  design a permutation-invariant pooling function without losing much instance-level
  information. Inspired by the dynamic routing in recent capsule networks, we propose
  a novel dynamic pooling function for MIL. It is an adaptive scheme for both key
  instance selection and modeling the contextual information among instances in a
  bag. The dynamic pooling iteratively updates the instance contribution to its bag.
  It is permutation-invariant and can interpret instance-to-bag relationship. The
  proposed dynamic pooling based multi-instance neural network has been validated
  on many MIL tasks and outperforms other MIL methods.
