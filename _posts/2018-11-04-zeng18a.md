title: Collaboratively Weighting Deep and Classic Representation via $l_2$ Regularization
  for Image Classification
abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks provide a powerful feature learning capability
  for image classification. The deep image features can be utilized to deal with many
  image understanding tasks like image classification and object recognition. However,
  the robustness obtained in one dataset can be hardly reproduced in the other domain,
  which leads to inefficient models far from state-of-the-art. We propose a deep collaborative
  weight-based classification (DeepCWC) method to resolve this problem, by providing
  a novel option to fully take advantage of deep features in classic machine learning.
  It firstly performs the $l_2$-norm based collaborative representation on the original
  images, as well as the deep features extracted by deep CNN models. Then, two distance
  vectors, obtained based on the pair of linear representations, are fused together
  via a novel collaborative weight. This collaborative weight enables deep and classic
  representations to weigh each other. We observed the complementarity between two
  representations in a series of experiments on 10 facial and object datasets. The
  proposed DeepCWC produces very promising classification results, and outperforms
  many other benchmark methods, especially the ones claimed for Fashion-MNIST. The
  code is going to be published in our public repository\footnote{https://github.com/zengsn/research}.
