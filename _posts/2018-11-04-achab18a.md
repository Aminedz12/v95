title: Profitable Bandits
abstract: 'Originally motivated by default risk management applications, this paper
  investigates a novel problem, referred to as the \emph{profitable bandit problem}
  here. At each step, an agent chooses a subset of the $K\geq 1$ possible actions.
  For each action chosen, she then respectively pays and receives the sum of a random
  number of costs and rewards. Her objective is to maximize her cumulated profit.
  We adapt and study three well-known strategies in this purpose, that were proved
  to be most efficient in other settings: \textsc{kl-UCB}, \textsc{Bayes-UCB} and
  \textsc{Thompson Sampling}. For each of them, we prove a finite time regret bound
  which, together with a lower bound we obtain as well, establishes asymptotic optimality
  in some cases. Our goal is also to \emph{compare} these three strategies from a
  theoretical and empirical perspective both at the same time. We give simple, self-contained
  proofs that emphasize their similarities, as well as their differences. While both
  Bayesian strategies are automatically adapted to the geometry of information, the
  numerical experiments carried out show a slight advantage for \textsc{Thompson Sampling}
  in practice.'
