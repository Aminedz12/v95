title: 'CHS-NET: A Cascaded Neural Network with Semi-Focal Loss for Mitosis Detection'
abstract: Counting of mitotic figures in hematoxylin and eosin(H&E) stained histological
  slide is the main indicator of tumor proliferation speed which is an important biomarker
  indicative of breast cancer patientsâ€™ prognosis. It is difficult to detect mitotic
  cells due to the diversity of the cells and the problem of class imbalance. We propose
  a new network called CHS-NET which is a cascaded neural network with hard example
  mining and semi-focal loss to detect mitotic cells in breast cancer. First, we propose
  a screening network to identify the candidates of mitotic cells preliminary and
  a refined network to identify mitotic cells from these candidates more accurately.
  We propose a new feature fusion module in each network to explore complex nonlinear
  predictors and improve accuracy. Then, we propose a novel loss named semi-focal
  loss and we use off-line hard example mining to solve the problem of class imbalance
  and error labeling. Finally, we propose a new training skill of cutting patches
  in the whole slide image, considering the size and distribution of mitotic cells.
  Our method achieves 0.68 F1 score which outperforms the best result in Tumor Proliferation
  Assessment Challenge 2016 held by MICCAI.
