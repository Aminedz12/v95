title: Who Are Raising Their Hands? Hand-Raiser Seeking Based on Object Detection
  and Pose Estimation
abstract: In this paper, we propose an automatic hand-raiser recognition algorithm
  to show who raise their hands in real classroom scenarios, which is of great importance
  for further analyzing the learning states of individuals. To recognize the hand-raisers,
  we divide the hand-raiser recognition into three subproblems, including hand-raising
  detection, pose estimation, and matching the raised hands to students. Several challenges
  exist while dealing with the above-mentioned subproblems, such as low resolution
  of the back row for keypoints detection, the motion distortion caused by hand raising
  in pose estimation, and various complex situations for matching. To solve these
  challenges, we first adopt an improved R-FCN algorithm for hand-raising detection,
  whose effectiveness has been demonstrated. Secondly, we present a novel PAF-based
  pose estimation algorithm for detecting keypoints of human bodies. The proposed
  PAF adds scale search and modified weight metric to adapt to the real and complex
  scenarios. Specifically, scale search improves the detection effect at low resolution
  by pooling human characteristics in different sizes of pictures, and modified weight
  metric reasonably utilizes the directional vectors of possible limb connections
  to optimize the case of motion distortion. Thirdly, a heuristic matching strategy
  based on the location of hand-raising and keypoints information is proposed to recognize
  the hand-raisers. Experimental results on six teaching videos in real classrooms
  have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and 83% recognition
  accuracy indicates the potential applications in real classrooms.
