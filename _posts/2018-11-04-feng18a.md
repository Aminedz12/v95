title: Fast Randomized PCA for Sparse Data
abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used for dimension reduction
  and embedding of real data in social network analysis, information retrieval, and
  natural language processing, etc. In this work we propose a fast randomized PCA
  algorithm for processing large sparse data. The algorithm has similar accuracy to
  the basic randomized SVD (rPCA) algorithm  (Halko et al., 2011), but is largely
  optimized for sparse data. It also has good flexibility to trade off runtime against
  accuracy for practical usage. Experiments on real data show that the proposed algorithm
  is up to 9.1X faster than the basic rPCA algorithm without accuracy loss, and is
  up to 20X faster than the \texttt{svds} in Matlab with little error. The algorithm
  computes the first 100 principal components of a large information retrieval data
  with 12,869,521 persons and 323,899 keywords in less than 400 seconds on a 24-core
  machine, while all conventional methods fail due to the out-of-memory issue.
