title: Underwater Image Restoration Based on Convolutional Neural Network
abstract: Restoring degraded underwater images is a challenging ill-posed problem.
  Existing priors-based approaches have limited performance in many situations due
  to their hand-designed features. In this paper, we propose an effective convolutional
  neural network (CNN) based approach for underwater image restoration, which consists
  of a transmission estimation network (T-network) and a global ambient light estimation
  network (A-network). By learning the relationship between the underwater scenes
  and their corresponding blue channel transmission map and global ambient light respectively,
  we can recover and enhance the underwater images with an underwater optical imaging
  model. In T-network, we use cross-layer connection and multi-scale estimation to
  prevent halo artifacts and to preserve edge features. Moreover, we develop a new
  underwater image synthetic method for training, which can simulate underwater images
  captured in various underwater environments. Experimental results of synthetic and
  real images demonstrate that our restored underwater images exhibits more natural
  color correction and better visibility improvement against these state-of-the-art
  methods.
