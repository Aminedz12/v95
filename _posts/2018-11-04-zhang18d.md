title: Relative Attribute Learning with Deep Attentive Cross-image Representation
abstract: In this paper, we study the relative attribute learning problem, which refers
  to comparing the strengths of a specific attribute between image pairs, with a new
  perspective of cross-image representation learning. In particular, we introduce
  a deep attentive cross-image representation learning (DACRL) model, which first
  extracts single-image representation with one shared subnetwork, and then learns
  attentive cross-image representation through considering the channel-wise attention
  of concatenated single-image feature maps. Taking a pair of images as input, DACRL
  outputs a posterior probability indicating whether the first image in the pair has
  a stronger presence of attribute than the second image. The whole network is jointly
  optimized via a unified end-to-end deep learning scheme. Extensive experiments on
  several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against
  the state-of-the-art methods.
