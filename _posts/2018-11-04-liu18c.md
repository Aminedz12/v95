title: Making Classifier Chains Resilient to Class Imbalance
abstract: Class imbalance is an intrinsic characteristic of multi-label data. Most
  of the labels in multi-label data sets are associated with a small number of training
  examples, much smaller compared to the size of the data set. Class imbalance poses
  a key challenge that plagues most multi-label learning methods. Ensemble of Classifier
  Chains (ECC), one of the most prominent multi-label learning methods, is no exception
  to this rule, as each of the binary models it builds is trained from all positive
  and negative examples of a label. To make ECC resilient to class imbalance, we first
  couple it with random undersampling. We then present two extensions  of this basic
  approach, where we build a varying number of binary models per label and construct
  chains of different sizes, in order to improve the exploitation of majority examples
  with approximately the same computational budget. Experimental results on 16 multi-label
  datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in a variety of
  evaluation metrics.
