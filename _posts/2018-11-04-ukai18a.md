title: Hypernetwork-based Implicit Posterior Estimation and Model Averaging of CNN
abstract: Deep neural networks have a rich ability to learn complex representations
  and achieved remarkable results in various tasks. However, they are prone to overfitting
  due to the limited number of training samples; regularizing the learning process
  of neural networks is critical. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization
  method, which estimates parameters of a large convolutional neural network as implicit
  probabilistic distributions generated by a hypernetwork. Also, we can perform model
  averaging to improve the network performance. Experimental results demonstrate our
  regularization method outperformed the commonly-used maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation.
