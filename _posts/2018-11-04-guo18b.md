title: Deep Embedded Clustering with Data Augmentation
abstract: Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) surpasses traditional clustering algorithms
  by jointly performing feature learning and cluster assignment. Although a lot of
  variants have emerged, they all ignore a crucial ingredient, \emph{data augmentation},
  which has been widely employed in supervised deep learning models to improve the
  generalization. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose the framework of Deep
  Embedded Clustering with Data Augmentation (DEC-DA). Specifically, we first train
  an autoencoder with the augmented data to construct the initial feature space. Then
  we constrain the embedded features with a clustering loss to further learn clustering-oriented
  features. The clustering loss is composed of the target (pseudo label) and the actual
  output of the feature learning model, where the target is computed by using clean
  (non-augmented) data, and the output by augmented data. This is analogous to supervised
  training with data augmentation and expected to facilitate unsupervised clustering
  too. Finally, we instantiate five DEC-DA based algorithms. Extensive experiments
  validate that incorporating data augmentation can improve the clustering performance
  by a large margin. Our DEC-DA algorithms become the new state of the art on various
  datasets.
