title: Deep Fully-Connected Part-Based Models for Human Pose Estimation
abstract: We propose a 2D multi-level appearance representation of the human body
  in RGB images, spatially modelled using a fully-connected graphical model. The appearance
  model is based on a CNN body part detector, which uses shared features in a cascade
  architecture to simultaneously detect body parts with different levels of granularity.
  We use a fully-connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) as our spatial model, over
  which approximate inference is efficiently performed using the Mean-Field algorithm,
  implemented as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The stronger visual support from
  body parts with different levels of granularity, along with the fully-connected
  pairwise spatial relations, which have their weights learnt by the model, improve
  the performance of the bottom-up part detector. We adopt an end-to-end training
  strategy to leverage the potential of both our appearance and spatial models, and
  achieve competitive results on the MPII and LSP datasets.
