title: An Empirical Evaluation of Sketched SVD and its Application to Leverage Score
  Ordering
abstract: The power of randomized algorithms in numerical methods have led to fast
  solutions which use the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as a core routine. However,
  given the large data size of modern and the modest runtime of SVD, most practical
  algorithms would require some form of approximation, such as sketching, when running
  SVD. While these approximation methods satisfy many theoretical guarantees, we provide
  the first algorithmic implementations for sketch-and-solve SVD problems on real-world,
  large-scale datasets. We provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation of these algorithms
  and provide guidelines on how to ensure accurate deployment to real-world data.
  As an application of sketched SVD, we present Sketched Leverage Score Ordering,
  a technique for determining the ordering of data in the training of neural networks.
  Our technique is based on the distributed computation of leverage scores using random
  projections. These computed leverage scores provide a flexible and efficient method
  to determine the optimal ordering of training data without manual intervention or
  annotations. We present empirical results on an extensive set of experiments across
  image classification, language sentiment analysis, and multi-modal sentiment analysis.
  Our method is faster compared to standard randomized projection algorithms and shows
  improvements in convergence and results.
