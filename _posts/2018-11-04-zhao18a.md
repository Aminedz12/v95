title: Refining Synthetic Images with Semantic Layouts by Adversarial Training
abstract: Recently, progress in learning-by-synthesis has proposed training models
  on synthetic images, which can effectively reduce the cost of manpower and material
  resources. However, learning from synthetic images still fails to achieve the desired
  performance compared to naturalistic images due to the different distribution of
  synthetic images. In an attempt to address this issue, previous methods were to
  improve the realism of synthetic images by learning a model. However, the disadvantage
  of the method is that the distortion has not been improved and the authenticity
  level is unstable. To solve this problem, we put forward a new structure to improve
  synthetic images, via the reference to the idea of style transformation, through
  which we can efficiently reduce the distortion of pictures and minimize the need
  of real data annotation. We estimate that this enables generation of highly realistic
  images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We quantitatively
  evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze estimation. We show a
  significant improvement over using synthetic images, and achieve state-of-the-art
  results on various datasets including MPIIGaze dataset.
