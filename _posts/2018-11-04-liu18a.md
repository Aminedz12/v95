title: Learning Selfie-Friendly Abstraction from Artistic Style Images
abstract: Artistic style transfer can be thought as a process to generate different
  versions of abstraction of the original image. However, most of the artistic style
  transfer operators are not optimized for human faces thus mainly suffers from two
  undesirable features when applying them to selfies. First, the edges of human faces
  may unpleasantly deviate from the ones in the original image. Second, the skin color
  is far from faithful to the original one which is usually problematic in producing
  quality selfies. In this paper, we take a different approach and formulate this
  abstraction process as a gradient domain learning problem. We aim to learn a type
  of abstraction which not only achieves the specified artistic style but also circumvents
  the two aforementioned drawbacks thus highly applicable to selfie photography. We
  also show that our method can be directly generalized to videos with high inter-frame
  consistency. Our method is also robust to non-selfie images, and the generalization
  to various kinds of real-life scenes is discussed. We will make our code publicly
  available.
