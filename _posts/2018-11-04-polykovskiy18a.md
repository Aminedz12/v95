title: 'Concorde: Morphological Agreement in Conversational Models'
abstract: 'Neural conversational models are widely used in applications such as personal
  assistants and chat bots. These models seem to give better performance when operating
  on the word level. However, for fusional languages such as French, Russian, or Polish,
  the vocabulary size can become infeasible since most of the words have multiple
  of word forms. To reduce vocabulary size, we propose a new pipeline for building
  conversational models: first generate words in a standard (lemmatized) form and
  then transform them into a grammatically correct sentence. In this work, we focus
  on the \emph{morphological agreement} part of the pipeline, i.e., reconstructing
  proper word forms from lemmatized sentences. For this task, we propose a neural
  network architecture that outperforms character-level models while being twice faster
  in training and 20% faster in inference. The proposed pipeline yields better performance
  than character-level conversational models according to human assessor testing.'
