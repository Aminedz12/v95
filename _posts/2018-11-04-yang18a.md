title: Boosting Dynamic Programming with Neural Networks for Solving NP-hard Problems
abstract: Dynamic programming is a powerful method for solving combinatorial optimization
  problems. However, it does not always work well, particularly for some NP-hard problems
  having extremely large state spaces. In this paper, we propose an approach to boost
  the capability of dynamic programming with neural networks. First, we replace the
  conventional tabular method with neural networks of polynomial sizes to approximately
  represent dynamic programming functions. And then we design an iterative algorithm
  to train the neural network with data generated from a solution reconstruction process.
  Our method combines the approximating ability and flexibility of neural networks
  and the advantage of dynamic programming in utilizing intrinsic properties of a
  problem. This approach can significantly reduce the space complexity and it is flexible
  in balancing space, running time, and accuracy. We apply the method to the Travelling
  Salesman Problem (TSP). The experimental results show that our approach can solve
  larger problems that are intractable for conventional dynamic programming and the
  performances are near optimal, outperforming the well-known approximation algorithms.
