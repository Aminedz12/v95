title: Deep Correlation Structure Preserved Label Space Embedding for Multi-label
  Classification
abstract: Label embedding is an effective and efficient method which can jointly extract
  the information of all labels for better performance of multi-label classification.
  However, most existing embedding methods ignore information of feature space or
  intrinsic structure of previous label space, such that their learned latent space
  will not have strong predictability and discriminant ability. We propose a novel
  deep neural network (DNN) based model, namely Deep Correlation Structure Preserved
  Label Space Embedding (DCSPE). Specifically, DCSPE derives a deep latent space by
  performing feature-aware label space embedding with deep canonical correlation analysis
  (DCCA) and preserving the intrinsic structure of the previous label space with proposed
  deep multidimensional scaling (DMDS). Our DCSPE is achieved by integrating the DNN
  architectures of the two DNN based models and can learn a feature-aware structure
  preserved deep latent space. Furthermore, extensive experimental results on datasets
  with many labels demonstrate that our proposed approach is significantly better
  than the existing label embedding algorithms.
