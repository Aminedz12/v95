title: Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Methods in Truncated Newton Frameworks for
  Large-scale Linear Classification
abstract: Truncated Newton method is one of the most effective optimization methods
  for large-scale linear classification. The main computational task at each Newton
  iteration is to approximately solve a quadratic sub-problem by an iterative procedure
  such as the conjugate gradient (CG) method. It is known that CG has slow convergence
  if the sub-problem is ill-conditioned. Preconditioned CG (PCG) methods have been
  used to improve the convergence of the CG method, but it is difficult to find a
  preconditioner that performs well in most situations. Further, because Hessian-free
  optimization techniques are incorporated for handling large data, many existing
  preconditioners are not directly applicable. In this work, we detailedly study some
  preconditioners that have been considered in past works for linear classification.
  We show that these preconditioners may not help to improve the training speed in
  some cases. After some investigation, we propose simple and effective techniques
  to make the PCG method more robust in a truncated Newton framework. The idea is
  to avoid the situation when a preconditioner leads to a much worse condition number
  than when it is not applied. We provide theoretical justification. Through carefully
  designed experiments, we demonstrate that our method can effectively reduce the
  training time for large-scale problems.
