title: A Self-Attentive Hierarchical Model for Jointly Improving Text Summarization
  and Sentiment Classification
abstract: Text summarization and sentiment classification, in NLP, are two main tasks
  implemented on text analysis, focusing on extracting the major idea of a text at
  different levels. Based on the characteristics of both, sentiment classification
  can be regarded as a more abstractive summarization task. According to the scheme,
  a Self-Attentive Hierarchical model for jointly improving text Summarization and
  Sentiment Classification (SAHSSC) is proposed in this paper. This model jointly
  performs abstractive text summarization and sentiment classification within a hierarchical
  end-to-end neural framework, in which the sentiment classification layer on top
  of the summarization layer predicts the sentiment label in the light of the text
  and the generated summary. Furthermore, a self-attention layer is also proposed
  in the hierarchical framework, which is the bridge that connects the summarization
  layer and the sentiment classification layer and aims at capturing emotional information
  at text-level as well as summary-level. The proposed model can generate a more relevant
  summary and lead to a more accurate summary-aware sentiment prediction. Experimental
  results evaluated on SNAP amazon online review datasets show that our model outperforms
  the state-of-the-art baselines on both abstractive text summarization and sentiment
  classification by a considerable margin.
