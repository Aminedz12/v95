title: Discriminative Feature Representation for Person Re-identification by Batch-contrastive
  Loss
abstract: In the past few years, person re-identification (reID) has developed rapidly
  due to the success of deep convolutional neural networks. The softmax loss function
  is an important component for learning discriminative features. However, the classifier
  trained by the softmax loss is difficult to distinguish the hard samples. In this
  work, we introduce a new auxiliary loss function, called batch-contrastive loss,
  for person reID to further separate the features of different identities and pulls
  the features of same identity closer. Furthermore, the proposed loss function does
  not rely on the pairwise or triplet sampling which is commonly used in the Siamese
  model. We test our loss function on two large-scale person reID benchmarks, Market-1501
  and DukeMTMC datasets. Under the combination of the batch-contrastive loss and the
  softmax loss, even only employing the generic L2-distance metric, we can achieve
  competitive results among the state-of-the-arts.
