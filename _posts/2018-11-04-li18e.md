title: Construction of Incoherent Dictionaries via Direct Babel Function Minimization
abstract: Highly incoherent dictionaries have broad applications in machine learning.
  Minimizing the mutual coherence is a common intuition to construct incoherent dictionaries
  in the previous methods. However, as pointed out by Tropp(2004), mutual coherence
  does not offer a very subtle description and Babel function, as a generalization
  of mutual coherence, is a more attractive alternative. However, it is much more
  challenging to optimize. In this work, we minimize the Babel function directly to
  construct incoherent dictionaries. As far as we know, this is the first work to
  optimize the Babel function. We propose an augmented Lagrange multiplier based algorithm
  to solve this nonconvex and nonsmooth problem with the convergence guarantee that
  every accumulation point is a KKT point. We define a new norm $\|\X\|_{\infty,max_p}$
  and propose an efficient method to compute its proximal operation with $O(n^2\mbox{log}n)$
  complexity, which dominates the running time of our algorithm, where $max_p$ means
  the sum of the largest $p$ elements and $n$ is the number of the atoms. Numerical
  experiments testify to the advantage of our method.
