title: 'ReSet: Learning Recurrent Dynamic Routing in ResNet-like Neural Networks'
abstract: Neural Network is a powerful Machine Learning tool that shows outstanding
  performance in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence.
  In particular, recently proposed ResNet architecture and its modifications produce
  state-of-the-art results in image classification problems. ResNet and most of the
  previously proposed architectures have a fixed structure and apply the same transformation
  to all input images. In this work, we develop a ResNet-based model that dynamically
  selects Computational Units (CU) for each input object from a learned set of transformations.
  Dynamic selection allows the network to learn a sequence of useful transformations
  and apply only required units to predict the image label. We compare our model to
  ResNet-38 architecture and achieve better results than the original ResNet on CIFAR-10.1
  test set. While examining the produced paths, we discovered that the network learned
  different routes for images from different classes and similar routes for similar
  images.
