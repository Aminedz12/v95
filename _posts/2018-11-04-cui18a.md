title: "Fast Dynamic Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual\r Tracking"
abstract: 'Most of the existing tracking methods based on CNN(convolutional neural
  networks) are too slow for real-time application despite the excellent tracking
  precision compared with the traditional ones. In this paper, a fast dynamic visual
  tracking algorithm combining CNN based MDNet(Multi-Domain Network) and RoIAlign
  was developed. The major problem of MDNet also lies in the time efficiency. Considering
  the computational complexity of MDNet is mainly caused by the large amount of convolution
  operations and fine-tuning of the network during tracking, a RoIPool layer which
  could conduct the convolution over the whole image instead of each RoI is added
  to accelerate the convolution and a new strategy of fine-tuning the fully-connected
  layers is used to accelerate the update. With RoIPool employed, the computation
  speed has been increased but the tracking precision has dropped simultaneously.
  RoIPool could lose some positioning precision because it can not handle locations
  represented by floating numbers. So RoIAlign, instead of RoIPool, which can process
  floating numbers of locations by bilinear interpolation has been added to the network.
  The results show the target localization precision has been improved and it hardly
  increases the computational cost. These strategies can accelerate the processing
  and make it 7  $\times$ faster than MDNet with very low impact on precision and
  it can run at around 7 fps. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on two benchmarks:
  OTB100 and VOT2016, on which high precision and speed have been obtained. The influence
  of the network structure and training data are also discussed with experiments.
