title: Character-based BiLSTM-CRF Incorporating POS and Dictionaries for Chinese Opinion
  Target Extraction
abstract: Opinion target extraction (OTE) is a fundamental step for sentiment analysis
  and opinion summarization. We analyze the difference between Chinese and the Indo-European
  languages family, and reduce Chinese OTE to a character-based sequence tagging task.
  Then we introduce two novel features for each character by distributing POS differentially
  and using predefined templates over contexts and dictionaries. We further propose
  a character-based BiLSTM-CRF model incorporating the two feature sequences aligned
  with the character sequence. Experimental results on real-world consumer review
  datasets show that our work significantly outperforms the baseline methods for Chinese
  OTE.
