title: A Scalable Heterogeneous Parallel SOM Based on MPI/CUDA
abstract: 'Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a kind of artificial neural network used in
  unsupervised machine learning, which is widely applied to clustering, dimension
  reduction and visualization for high-dimensional data, etc. There are two major
  versions of the training algorithm: original algorithm and batch algorithm. Compared
  with the original, the batch algorithm has some advantages including faster convergence
  and less computation, and is suitable for parallelization. However, it is still
  confronted with the challenge of eficiency in the case of massive data, high-dimensional
  data or a large-scale map. In this paper, a scalable heterogeneous parallel SOM
  based on the batch algorithm is proposed which combines process-level and thread-level
  parallelism by MPI and CUDA. To boost the parallel efficiency on GPUs and make full
  use of the high floating-point computing capability, we design matrix operations
  for the the most time-consuming steps, the computation of best match units and weights
  update, making the steps available for the implementation by cuBLAS. In addition,
  the memory optimization methods are adopted. The experiments show that the proposed
  heterogeneous parallel SOM is effective, efficient and scalable.'
