title: 'Adversarial TableQA: Attention Supervision for Question Answering on Tables'
abstract: The task of answering a question given a text passage has shown great developments
  on model performance thanks to community efforts in building useful datasets. Recently,
  there have been doubts whether such rapid progress has been based on truly understanding
  language. The same question has not been asked in the table question answering (TableQA)
  task, where we are tasked to answer a query given a table. We show that existing
  efforts, of using “answers” for both evaluation and supervision for TableQA, show
  deteriorating performances in adversarial settings of perturbations that do not
  affect the answer. This insight naturally motivates to develop new models that understand
  question and table more precisely. For this goal, we propose \textsc{Neural Operator
  (NeOp)}, a multi-layer sequential network with attention supervision to answer the
  query given a table. \textsc{NeOp} uses multiple Selective Recurrent Units (SelRUs)
  to further help the interpretability of the answers of the model. Experiments show
  that the use of operand information to train the model significantly improves the
  performance and interpretability of TableQA models. \textsc{NeOp} outperforms all
  the previous models by a big margin.
