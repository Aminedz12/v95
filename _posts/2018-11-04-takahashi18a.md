title: 'RICAP: Random Image Cropping and Patching Data Augmentation for Deep CNNs'
abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results
  in image recognition owing to their rich expression ability and numerous parameters.
  However, an excessive expression ability compared to the variety of training images
  often has a risk of overfitting. Data augmentation techniques have been proposed
  to address this problem as they enrich datasets by flipping, cropping, resizing,
  and color-translating images. They enable deep CNNs to achieve an impressive performance.
  In this study, we propose a new data augmentation technique called \emph{random
  image cropping and patching} (\emph{RICAP}), which randomly crops four images and
  patches them to construct a new training image. Hence, RICAP randomly picks up subsets
  of original features among the four images and discard others, enriching the variety
  of training images. Also, RICAP mixes the class labels of the four images and enjoys
  a benefit similar to label smoothing. We evaluated RICAP with current state-of-the-art
  CNNs (e.g., shake-shake regularization model) and achieved a new state-of-the-art
  test error of \textcolor{red}{$2.23%$} on CIFAR-10 among competitive data augmentation
  techniques such as cutout and mixup. We also confirmed that deep CNNs with RICAP
  achieved better results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet than those results obtained by
  other techniques.
