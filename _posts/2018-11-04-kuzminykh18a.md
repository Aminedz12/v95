title: Extracting Invariant Features From Images Using An Equivariant Autoencoder
abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks achieve state of the art results in many image
  recognition tasks. While their structure makes predictions invariant to small translations,
  some recognition tasks require invariance to other transformations, like rotation
  and reflection. We apply group convolutions to build an Equivariant Autoencoder
  with embeddings that change predictably under the specified set of transformations.
  We then introduce two approaches to extracting invariant features from these embeddingsâ€”Gram
  Pooling and Equivariant Attention. These two methods separate transformation-relevant
  information from all other image features. We use obtained embeddings in classification
  and clustering tasks and show an improvement of the classification quality on the
  learned embeddings compared to pure autoencoder and average pooling method. A visualization
  of the learned manifold shows that objects of the same class tend to cluster together,
  which was not observed for the pure autoencoder embeddings.
