title: Co-regularized Multi-view Subspace Clustering
abstract: For many clustering applications, Multi-view data sets are very common.
  Multi-view clustering aims to exploit information across views instead of individual
  views, which is promising to improve clustering performance. Note that a high-dimensional
  data set usually distributes on certain low-dimensional subspace. Thus, many multi-view
  subspace clustering algorithms have been developed. However, existing multi-view
  subspace clustering methods rarely perform clustering on the subspace representation
  of each view simultaneously as well as keep the indicator consistency among the
  representations, i.e., the same data point in different views should be assigned
  to the same cluster. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view subspace clustering
  method. In our method, we use the indicator matrix to ensure that we perform clustering
  on the subspace representation of each view simultaneously. And at the same time,
  a co-regularized term is added to guarantee the consistency of the indicator matrices.
  Experiments on several real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
  and superiority of our proposed method.
