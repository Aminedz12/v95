title: End-to-End Time Series Imputation via Residual Short Paths
abstract: "Time series imputation (replacing\r missing data) plays an important role
  in time series analysis due to missing values in real world data. How to recover
  missing values and model the underlying dynamic dependencies from incomplete time
  series remains a challenge. A recent work has found that residual networks help
  build very deep networks by leveraging short paths due to skip connections (Veit
  et al., 2016). Inspired by this, we observe that these short paths can model underlying
  correlations between missing items and their previous non-missing observations in
  a graph-like way. Hence, we propose an end-to-end imputation network with residual
  short paths, called Residual IMPutation LSTM (RIMP-LSTM), a flexible combination
  of residual short paths with graph-based temporal dependencies. We construct a residual
  sum unit (RSU), which enables RIMP-LSTM to make full use of previous revealed information
  to model incomplete time series and reduce the negative impact of missing values.
  Moreover, a switch unit is designed to detect the missing values and a new loss
  function is then developed to train our model with time series in the presence of
  missing values in an end-to-end way, which also allows simultaneous imputation and
  prediction. Extensive empirical comparisons with other competitive imputation approaches
  over several synthetic and real world time series with various rates of missing
  data verify the superiority of our model."
