title: Adversarial Neural Machine Translation
abstract: In this paper, we study a new learning paradigm for neural machine translation
  (NMT). Instead of maximizing the likelihood of the human translation as in previous
  works, we minimize the distinction between human translation and the translation
  given by an NMT model. To achieve this goal, inspired by the recent success of generative
  adversarial networks (GANs), we employ an adversarial training architecture and
  name it as Adversarial-NMT. In Adversarial-NMT, the training of the NMT model is
  assisted by an adversary, which is an elaborately designed $2D$ convolutional neural
  network (CNN). The goal of the adversary is to differentiate the translation result
  generated by the NMT model from that by human. The goal of the NMT model is to produce
  high quality translations so as to cheat the adversary. A policy gradient method
  is leveraged to co-train the NMT model and the adversary. Experimental results on
  English$\rightarrow$French and German$\rightarrow$English translation tasks show
  that Adversarial-NMT can achieve significantly better translation quality than several
  strong baselines.
