title: Optimization Algorithm Inspired Deep Neural Network Structure Design
abstract: Deep neural networks have been one of the dominant machine learning approaches
  in recent years. Several new network structures are proposed and have better performance
  than the traditional feedforward neural network structure. Representative ones include
  the skip connection structure in ResNet and the dense connection structure in DenseNet.
  However, it still lacks a unified guidance for the neural network structure design.
  In this paper, we propose the hypothesis that the neural network structure design
  can be inspired by optimization algorithms and a faster optimization algorithm may
  lead to a better neural network structure. Specifically, we prove that the propagation
  in the feedforward neural network with the same linear transformation in different
  layers is equivalent to minimizing some function using the gradient descent algorithm.
  Based on this observation, we replace the gradient descent algorithm with the heavy
  ball algorithm and Nesterovâ€™s accelerated gradient descent algorithm, which are
  faster and inspire us to design new and better network structures. ResNet and DenseNet
  can be considered as two special cases of our framework. Numerical experiments on
  CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet verify the advantage of our optimization algorithm
  inspired structures over ResNet and DenseNet.
