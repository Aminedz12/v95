title: Unsupervised Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation with Sparse Feature Transformation
abstract: Heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA), which aims to adapt information across
  domains with different input feature spaces, has attracted a lot of attention recently.
  However,  many existing HDA approaches rely on labeled data in the target domain,
  which is either scarce or even absent in many tasks. In this paper, we propose a
  novel unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation approach to bridge the representation
  gap between the source and target domains. The proposed method learns a sparse feature
  transformation function based on the data in both the source and target domains
  and a small number of existing parallel instances. The learning problem is formulated
  as a sparsity regularized optimization problem and an ADMM algorithm is developed
  to solve it. We conduct experiments on several real-world domain adaptation datasets
  and the experimental results validate the advantages of the proposed method over
  existing unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation approaches.
