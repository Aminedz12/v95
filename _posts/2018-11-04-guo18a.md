title: 'Multidimensional Time Series Anomaly Detection: A GRU-based Gaussian Mixture
  Variational Autoencoder Approach'
abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection on multidimensional time series data is a
  very important problem due to its wide applications in many systems such as cyber-physical
  systems, the Internet of Things. Some existing works use traditional variational
  autoencoder (VAE) for anomaly detection. They generally assume a single-modal Gaussian
  distribution as prior in the data generative procedure. However, because of the
  intrinsic multimodality in time series data, previous works cannot effectively learn
  the complex data distribution, and hence cannot make accurate detections. To tackle
  this challenge, in this paper, we propose a GRU-based Gaussian Mixture VAE system
  for anomaly detection, called GGM-VAE. In particular, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
  cells are employed to discover the correlations among time sequences. Then we use
  Gaussian Mixture priors in the latent space to characterize multimodal data. The
  proposed detector reports an anomaly when the reconstruction probability is below
  a certain threshold. We conduct extensive simulations on real world datasets and
  find that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection
  schemes and achieves up to 5.7% and 7.2% improvements in accuracy and F1 score,
  respectively, compared with existing methods.
