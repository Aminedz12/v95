abstract: This paper focuses on predicting rating scores of new restaurants listed
  in online restaurant review platforms. Most existing works rely on customer reviews
  to make an prediction. However, in practice, the customer reviews for new restaurants
  are always missing. In this paper, we mine useful features from the information
  of restaurants as well as highly available urban data to tackle this problem. We
  propose a deep-learning based approach called MR-Net to model both endogenous and
  exogenous factors in a unified manner and capture deep feature interaction for rating
  score prediction. Extensive experiments on real world data from Dianping show that
  our approach achieves better performance than various baseline methods. To the best
  of our knowledge, it is the first work that predicts rating scores for new restaurants
  without the knowledge of customer reviews.
