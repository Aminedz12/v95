title: Feature-correlation-aware Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model
abstract: Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) is a powerful nonlinear dimension
  reduction model and has been widely used in many machine learning scenarios. However,
  the original GPLVM and its variants do not explicitly model the correlations among
  the original features, leading to the underutilization of underlying information
  involved in the data. To compensate for this shortcoming, we propose a feature-correlation-aware
  GPLVM (fcaGPLVM) to simultaneously learn the latent variables and the feature correlations.
  The main contributions of this paper are 1) introducing a set of extra latent variables
  into the original GPLVM and proposing a feature-correlation-aware kernel function
  to explicitly model  the feature-description information and infer the feature correlations;
  2) defining a joint objective function and developing a stochastic optimization
  algorithm based on the stochastic variational inference (SVI) to learn all the latent
  variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly
  considers the feature correlations in the GPLVM and makes many existing GPLVMs become
  its special cases. Furthermore, it can be applied to both unsupervised and supervised
  learnings to improve the performance of dimension reduction. Experimental results
  show that in these two learning scenarios the proposed models outperform their state-of-the-art
  counterparts.
