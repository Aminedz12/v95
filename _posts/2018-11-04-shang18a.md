title: 'ZoomNet: Deep Aggregation Learning for High-Performance Small Pedestrian Detection'
abstract: It remains very challenging for a single deep model to detect pedestrians
  of different sizes appears in an image. One typical remedy for the small pedestrian
  detection is to up-sample the input and pass it to the network multiple times. Unfortunately
  this strategy not only exponentially increases the computational cost but also probably
  impairs the model effectiveness. In this work, we present a deep architecture, refereed
  to as ZoomNet, which performs small pedestrian detection by deep aggregation learning
  without up-sampling the input. ZoomNet learns and aggregates deep feature representations
  at multiple levels and retains the spatial information of the pedestrian from different
  scales. ZoomNet also learns to cultivate the feature representations from the classification
  task to the detection task and obtains further performance improvements. Extensive
  experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ZoomNet. The
  source code of this work will be made public available to facilitate further studies
  on this problem.
