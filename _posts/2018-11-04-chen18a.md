title: 'SecureNets: Secure Inference of Deep Neural Networks on an Untrusted Cloud'
abstract: Inference using deep neural networks may be outsourced to the cloud due
  to its high computational cost, which, however, raises security concerns. Particularly,
  the data involved in deep neural networks can be highly sensitive, such as in medical,
  financial, commercial applications, and hence should be kept private. Besides, the
  deep neural network models owned by research institutions or commercial companies
  are their valuable intellectual properties and can contain proprietary information,
  which should be protected as well. Moreover, an untrusted cloud service provider
  may return accurate and even erroneous computing results. To address the above issues,
  we propose a secure outsourcing framework for deep neural network inference called
  SecureNets, which can preserve both a userâ€™s data privacy and his/her neural network
  model privacy, and also verify the computation results returned by the cloud. Specifically,
  we employ a secure matrix transformation scheme in SecureNets to avoid privacy leakage
  of the data and the model. Meanwhile, we propose a verification method that can
  efficiently verify the correctness of cloud computing results. Our simulation results
  on four- and five-layer deep neural networks demonstrate that SecureNets can reduce
  the processing runtime by up to $64%$. Compared with CryptoNets, one of the previous
  schemes, SecureNets can increase the throughput by $104.45%$ while reducing the
  data transmission size by $69.78%$ per instance.
