title: End-to-End Learning of Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network for Stereo
  Matching
abstract: Deep neural networks have shown excellent performance in stereo matching
  task. Recently CNN-based methods have shown that stereo matching can be formulated
  as a supervised learning task. However, less attention is paid on the fusion of
  contextual semantic information and details. To tackle this problem, we propose
  a network for disparity estimation based on abundant contextual details and semantic
  information, called Multi-scale Features Network (MSFNet). First, we design a new
  structure to encode rich semantic information and fine-grained details by fusing
  multi-scale features. And we combine the advantages of element-wise addition and
  concatenation, which is conducive to merge semantic information with details. Second,
  a guidance mechanism is introduced to guide the network to automatically focus more
  on the unreliable regions. Third, we formulate the consistency check as an error
  map, obtained by the low stage features with fine-grained details. Finally, we adopt
  the consistency checking between the left feature and the synthetic left feature
  to refine the initial disparity. Experiments on Scene Flow and KITTI 2015 benchmark
  demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.
