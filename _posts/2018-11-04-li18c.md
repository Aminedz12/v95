title: Stock Price Prediction Using Attention-based Multi-Input LSTM
abstract: Stock price prediction has always been a hot but challenging task due to
  the complexity and randomness in stock market. Investors and researchers usually
  derive a great number of factors from original data such as historical stock price,
  company profit, or textual data collected from social media. Normally these factors
  are then fed into models like linear regression, SVM or neural networks to make
  a prediction. Even though the number of factors are considerable, most of them have
  relatively weak correlations with future stock price. During training process, these
  factors not only result in additional computation but sometimes even be harmful
  to the performance of prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-input
  LSTM model which is capable of extracting valuable information from low-correlated
  factors and discarding their harmful noise by employing extra input gates controlled
  by the convincing factors called \emph{mainstream}. We also introduce several new
  factors including the prices of other related stocks to improve the prediction accuracy.
  The experimental results on the stock data from China stock market demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
