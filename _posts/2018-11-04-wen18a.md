title: 'CCNet: Cluster-Coordinated Net for Learning Multi-agent Communication Protocols
  with Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: Multi-agent system is crucial for many practical applications. Recent years
  have witnessed numerous research on multi-agent task with reinforcement learning
  (RL) algorithms. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms often fail to learn
  the cooperation between different agents, which is vital for multi-agent problems.
  A promising solution is to establish a communication protocol among agents. However,
  existing approaches often suffer from generalization challenges especially in tasks
  with partial observation and dynamic variation of agent amount. In this paper, we
  develop a Cluster-Coordinated Network (CCNet) to address the “Learning-to-communicate”
  problem in multi-agent system by utilizing the combination of a trainable Vector
  of Locally Aggregated Descriptor (VLAD) algorithm and reinforcement learning. Embedding
  with a VLAD based end-to-end trainable communication information processing module
  (called VLAD Processing Core), CCNet can learn efficient communication protocols
  even from scratch under partially observable environments and possesses robustness
  to the dynamic changes of agent number as well. Moreover, with the help of communication,
  CCNet is with less non-stationarity when training the network by common RL algorithms.
  We evaluated the proposed CCNet on two multi-agent partially observable tasks, \emph{i.e.},
  Traffic Junction and Combat Task. The experimental results have demonstrated that
  CCNet is effective and improves the performance by a large margin over the state-of-the-art
  methods.
