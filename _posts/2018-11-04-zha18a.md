title: Joint Patch-Group Based Sparse Representation for Image Inpainting
abstract: Sparse representation has achieved great successes in various machine learning
  and image processing tasks. For image processing, typical patch-based sparse representation
  (PSR) models usually tend to generate undesirable visual artifacts, while group-based
  sparse representation (GSR) models produce over-smooth phenomena. In this paper,
  we propose a new sparse representation model, termed joint patch-group based sparse
  representation (JPG-SR). Compared with existing sparse representation models, the
  proposed JPG-SR provides a powerful mechanism to integrate the local sparsity and
  nonlocal self-similarity of images. We then apply the proposed JPG-SR model to a
  low-level vision problem, namely, image inpainting. To make the proposed scheme
  tractable and robust, an iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction
  method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is developed to solve the proposed JPG-SR
  model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is efficient and
  outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in both objective and  perceptual quality.
