title: Efficient Mechanisms for Peer Grading and Dueling Bandits
abstract: 'Many scenarios in our daily life require us to infer some ranking over
  items or people based on limited information. In this paper, we consider two such
  scenarios, one for ranking student papers in massive online open courses and one
  for identifying the best player (or team) in sports tournaments. For the peer grading
  problem, we design a mechanism with a new way of matching graders to papers. This
  allows us to aggregate partial rankings from graders into a global one, with an
  accuracy rate matching the best in previous works, but with a much simpler analysis.
  For the winner selection problem in sports tournaments, we cast it as the well-known
  dueling bandit problem and identify a new measure to minimize: the number of parallel
  rounds, as one normally would not like a large tournament to last too long. We provide
  mechanisms which can determine the optimal or an almost optimal player in a small
  number of parallel rounds and at the same time using a small number of competitions.'
